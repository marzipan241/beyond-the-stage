## Final Project Milestone

```{r}
# Rough Github repo, with all necessary data, and reproducible Rmd document. The Rmd must contain two items. First, a brief description of the data, where you got, what you have done with it so far and what you plan to do. Second, a beautiful ggplot2 graphic using some of the data.
```

## Notes to Self

#### Twitter API

* API: Application Programming Interface

* Search API

* May need to use Python package tweepy

#### Limitations of Twitter Data

* Can't collect data on observers

* Restricted access (about 1% sample) 

* Can't collect historical data
