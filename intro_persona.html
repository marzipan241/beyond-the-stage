<td valign="top">‘Who am I’ the question I had my whole life<br>
The question which I probably won’t find an answer to my whole life<br>
If I were answerable with a few mere words<br>
Then God wouldn’t have created<br>
All those various beauties<br>
How you feel? How’re you feeling right now?<br>
Actually I am real good but a little uncomfortable<br>
I am still not so sure<br>
If I am a dog or a pig or what else<br>
But then other people come and put the pearl necklace on me<br>
Ptui<p></p>
<p>I laugh more than I did before<br>
I dreamt of becoming a superhero<br>
Now it feels like I really became one<br>
But as it goes on there’s so much blabbering<br>
One says ‘run’ another says ‘stop’<br>
This one says ‘look at the forest’, that one says ‘look at the wild flower’<br>
My shadow, I wrote and called it ‘hesitation’<br>
It has never hesitated after becoming that<br>
It keeps appearing under the stage or the light<br>
Keeps glaring at me scorchingly like a heat wave<br>
(oh shit)<br>
Hey have you already forgotten why you even started this<br>
You were just digging it that someone was listening<br>
Sometimes everything sounds like freakin’ nonsense<br>
You know what comes out of you when your drunk.. like immaturity<br>
Someone like me ain’t good enough for music<br>
Someone like me ain’t good enough for the truth<br>
Someone like me ain’t good enough for a calling<br>
Someone like me ain’t good enough to be a muse<br>
The flaws of mine that I know, maybe that’s all I have got really<br>
The world is actually not interested in my clumsiness at all<br>
The regrets that I don’t even get sick of anymore<br>
I tumble with them every night until I am disgusted<br>
And twist the irreversible time habitually<br>
There’s something that raised me up again every time<br>
The first question<br>
The three syllables of my name and the word ‘but’<br>
That should come before any of those</p>
<p>So I’m askin’ once again yeah<br>
Who the hell am I?<br>
Tell me all your names baby<br>
Do you wanna die?<br>
Oh do you wanna go?<br>
Do you wanna fly?<br>
Where’s your soul? where’s your dream?<br>
Do you think you’re alive?</p>
<p>My name is R<br>
The ‘me’ that I remember and people know<br>
The ‘me’ that I created myself to vent out<br>
Yeah maybe I’ve been deceiving myself<br>
Maybe I have been lying<br>
But I am not embarrassed anymore this is the map of my soul<br>
Dear myself, you must never lose your temperature<br>
Cuz you don’t need to be neither warm nor cold<br>
Though I might sometimes be hypocritical or pretend to be evil<br>
This is the barometer of my direction I want to keep<br>
The ‘me’ that I want myself to be<br>
The ‘me’ that people want me to be<br>
The ‘me’ that you love<br>
And the ‘me’ that I create<br>
The ‘me’ that’s smiling<br>
The ‘me’ that’s sometimes in tear<br>
Vividly breathing each second and every moment even now</p>
<p>Persona<br>
Who the hell am I<br>
I just wanna go I just wanna fly<br>
I just wanna give you<br>
All the voices till I die<br>
I just wanna give you<br>
All the shoulders when you cry</p>
<p>Persona<br>
Who the hell am I<br>
I just wanna go I just wanna fly<br>
I just wanna give you<br>
All the voices till I die<br>
I just wanna give you<br>
All the shoulders when you cry</p></td>
