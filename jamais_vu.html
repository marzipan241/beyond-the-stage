<p style="text-align: center;">I think I lost again<br>
You look mad<br>
In a blur, game over over over</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If this was truly a game,<br>
I could probably just load up again<br>
I guess I gotta<br>
Deal with this, deal with this<br>
Real world</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I’d be better actually, if this was really a game.<br>
Because it pains me so much<br>
I need to heal my medic<br>
But I’m another star<br>
I blame myself who couldn’t be perfect<br>
Brake in my head,<br>
Brake in my step, always<br>
I wanted to do well<br>
I wanted to make you smile..damn</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Please give me a remedy<br>
A remedy that will make my heart beat again<br>
What should I do now<br>
Please save me, give me another chance<br>
Please give me a</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A remedy, a melody<br>
A memory that will be left behind just for me<br>
If I stop at this point<br>
If I just turn it off, everything will be more<br>
comfortable</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I’m okay but I’m not okay<br>
I told myself I’m used to it<br>
But I’m in pain like it’s the first time</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A lacking gamer, you’re right, you can’t control me.<br>
I keep hurting cause of my repeated mistakes and<br>
50 thousand other things.<br>
My song lyrics, my one body gesture<br>
All of my words become afraid of my jamais vu<br>
and try to escape.<br>
But still, you grab it.<br>
My shadow becomes bigger<br>
My life and you equal(=) sign<br>
So my remedy is your remedy</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Please give me a remedy<br>
A remedy that will make my heart beat again<br>
What should I do now<br>
Please save me, give me another chance<br>
Please give me a</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Remedy)<br>
I continue running, and I stumble again<br>
(Honestly)<br>
Although I repeat countless times<br>
I’m gonna continue running</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So give me a remedy<br>
A remedy that will make my heart beat again<br>
What should I do now<br>
Please save me, give me another chance</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Please give me a remedy<br>
(Is this a success? I returned)<br>
A remedy that will make my heart beat again<br>
(I will focus and will reach you no matter what.<br>
Falling, stumbling)<br>
What should I do now?<br>
(The familiar pain attacks me the same way)<br>
Save me<br>
(I’s not easy this time either)<br>
Please give me another chance<br>
(Will I give up, you ask? No, no never)<br>
I won’t give up</p>
